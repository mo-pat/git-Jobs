# git-Jobs
A python app that will store and print out the latest jobs posted that day on indeed.com. 

## Getting Started
1. To run the program, enter <code>python3 main.py</code>. Currently this runs only with python3

2. Enter job search param (ex: Software Developer) when prompted. A list of all the jobs posted with that search param should show on console.

## Future
Planning to either make a front-end browser app to display the job postings or using a service to send daily email notifications to its subscribers. Not sure yet.
